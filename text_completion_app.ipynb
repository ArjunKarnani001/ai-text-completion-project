This can be very interesting.

The dataset would contain a whole bunch of data (such as a movie score, job title, and job posting) and the results would be then used for the supervised learning. In other words, if you had a dataset with a large number of data points, for instance, you might want to run a small sample of the dataset and compare the data with the results.\n",
