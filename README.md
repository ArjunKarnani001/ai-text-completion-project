# 🧠 AI Text Completion Project

This project is a hands-on exploration of **Generative AI** using Hugging Face’s GPT-2 model to generate text completions based on a variety of prompts. The goal is to understand how AI responds to different types of input and how parameters like temperature and max token length affect the generated output.

## 📌 Project Overview

We built a Python-based text generation application using Hugging Face's `transformers` library. The app takes in a user-defined prompt, sends it to the GPT-2 model, and returns a coherent response.

Prompts tested ranged across creative storytelling, technical explanations, summaries, and even fun hypotheticals like “What if cats ruled the world?”
